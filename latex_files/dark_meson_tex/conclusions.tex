Results from a search for dark mesons originating from strongly-coupled, $SU(2)$ dark flavor symmetry conserving models and decaying to top and bottom quarks are reported. The analysis is based on the full Run~2 data sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \lumi. The search is performed in the \allhad channel, where the event signature results in eight to ten jets of which at least four originate from bottom quarks, and in the \onelep channel, corresponding to final states with one electron or muon in addition to jets. In the \allhad channel, a data-driven technique is used to estimate the predominant multijet background. In the \onelep channel, the dominant background comes from \ttbar production and is estimated from MC simulations.

No excess above the SM background expectation is observed. The strongest exclusion limits are obtained from the \onelep channel. For \sul signals with $m_{\piD}/m_{\rho_D}=0.45$, dark pions with masses $\dpmass<940~\GeV$ are excluded, while for $m_{\piD}/m_{\rho_D}=0.25$ the exclusion covers the mass range $\dpmass<740~\GeV$. These results constitute the first direct collider constraints on this type of model, and significantly extend the phase space previously excluded through re-interpretation of other collider searches.
