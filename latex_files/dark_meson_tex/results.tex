As can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:postfit_distribution} and Table~\ref{tab:allhad_sr_yields}, the data are very well described by the background-only hypothesis with no significant excess of events above SM prediction. We set $95\%$ confidence level (CL) upper limits on the dark pion production cross-sections following the $\text{CL}_S$ technique~\cite{Read:2002hq}. 

Using the predicted dark pion production cross-sections, the limits can be translated into limits on dark pion masses in the two-dimensional $\etaD\text{--}\dpmass$ plane as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:allhad_unblinded_limits_su2l_2d}. 
%Figure~\ref{fig:allhad_limits_unblinded_su2l_1d} shows the \sul exclusion limits for dark pions at four different $\eta$ values. 
No dark pion masses can be excluded for $\etaD=0.15$. For $\etaD=0.25$ the exclusion covers the mass range $280~\GeV<\dpmass<522~\GeV$ (expected $280~\GeV<\dpmass<542~\GeV$), while for $\etaD=0.35$, dark pions with masses $\dpmass<434~\GeV$ are excluded (expected $\dpmass<448~\GeV$). %For $\etaD=0.45$ the excluded range cannot be extended beyond the range already excluded by reinterpretation of other ATLAS or CMS analyses~\cite{Kribs:2018ilo}. 
%The excluded region can also be plotted in the two-dimensional $\etaD\text{--}\dpmass$--plane, which was done in figure~\ref{fig:allhad_unblinded_limits_su2l_2d} and shows again a good agreement between the expected and the observed exclusion limits.

  \caption{Observed (red solid line) and expected (black dashed line) exclusion contours at $95\%$ CL in the $\etaD\text{--}m_{\pi_D}$ plane for \sul signal models. Masses that are within the contours are excluded. An uncertainty band (yellow) corresponding to the $\pm 1\sigma$ variation on the expected limit is also indicated. The grey area indicates the phase space previously excluded through re-interpretation of other collider searches presented in Ref.~\cite{Butterworth_2022}.}
