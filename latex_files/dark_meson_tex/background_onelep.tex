The background in the \onelep channel is estimated from MC simulations using the samples described in Section~\ref{sec:samples} and is dominated by \ttbar production in association with light-flavor or heavy-flavor quarks. This background is estimated by using the inclusive \ttbar sample complemented by the dedicated \ttbb sample, with events categorized into \ttb, \ttc and \ttlight as described in Section~\ref{sec:samples}. The \ttbar+HF background that populates the SR is known from previous studies to be underestimated by the current MC predictions~\cite{TOPQ-2017-12}. This mismodeling is corrected by keeping the normalization of these backgrounds unconstrained in the profile-likelihood fit to the \dave distribution. To this end, the \ttc and \ttlight contributions are combined and two normalization factors are fit depending on whether in addition to \ttbar any $b$-quarks are present in the event. In this categorization, the combination of the \ttc and \ttlight backgrounds is referred to as \ttnb. The resulting background estimates for the SR, CR and VR are presented in Section~\ref{sec:fit_onelep}.
