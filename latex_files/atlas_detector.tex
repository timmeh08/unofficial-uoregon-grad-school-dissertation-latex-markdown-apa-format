The ATLAS detector is a general purpose detector at point 1 of the LHC ring.
It is designed to detect and measure the scattering products of collisions provided by the LHC.
Cylindrical in design, it is symmetric about the z-axis, and measures approximately 25 m in height and 44 m in length, with a total mass of about 7000 tons. \cite{PERF-2007-01}.
ATLAS consists of several sub-detector systems arranged in layers around the interaction point, as shown in Fig. \ref{atlas_schematic}.
