Data samples for 2023 are described in section~\ref{sec:data} and Monte Carlo in section~\ref{sec:mc}. The data and MC were both processed from common DAOD\_PHYS samples, using a framework based on SUSYTools \footnote{Analysis framework available at \href{https://gitlab.cern.ch/gghyyd/analysiscode}{https://gitlab.cern.ch/gghyyd/analysiscode}}.
