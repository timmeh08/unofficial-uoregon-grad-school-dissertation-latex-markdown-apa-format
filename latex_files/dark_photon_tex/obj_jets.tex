Particle flow (PFlow) jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm with a radius parameter of
$R = 0.4$, taking as input charged constituents associated with the primary vertex and neutral PFlow constituents.
Jet candidates are required to have $p_{\mathrm{T}}>20$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.5$. A NN based jet vertex tagger (NNJvt) discriminant
is used to identify central jets (within $|\eta|<2.5$) originating from the hard scattered (HS) interaction, employing the \texttt{FixedEffPt} WP. For more forward jets, a forward jet vertex tagging algorithm (fJVT) is applied with \texttt{Loose} WP. 
Jets containing b-hadrons (b-jets) are identified through the \texttt{GN2v01} tagger with \texttt{Continuous} WP.
