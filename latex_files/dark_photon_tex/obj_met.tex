The missing transverse momentum $\ETmiss$ , originating from the unbalanced momentum in the transverse plane, is defined as the negative vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all baseline
electrons, muons, photons, PFlow jets, and of the “soft term”, which is estimated from tracks associated with the primary vertex, but not matched to any of those objects. The Tight WP is used, building the jet term only from jets with $_{\mathrm{T}}>20$ GeV, with a tight requirement on the NNJVT score.\\
