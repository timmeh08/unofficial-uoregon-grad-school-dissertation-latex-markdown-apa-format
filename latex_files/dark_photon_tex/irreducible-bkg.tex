$Z\gamma$ and $W\gamma$  consitute the real-$\gamma$ backgrounds for this analysis, in particular the $Z(\xrightarrow[]{}\nu\nu)\gamma$ consists in the irreducible background due to a final state $\gamma+\MET$ similarly to signal events.

The strategy to estimate these backgrounds is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item define leptonic Control Regions (CRs), as detailed in section \ref{sec:crvr}: $1\mu$ CR for $W\gamma$ and $2\mu$ CR for $Z\gamma$; 
    \item evaluate the normalization factors (k-factors) for these backgrounds from a simultaneous fit described in Section \ref{sec:statanalysis};
    \item apply the k-factors to MC simulation in SR to get the final estimation of the backgrounds. 
\end{enumerate}
