The results presented in this thesis were obtained with the ATLAS detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Section \ref{sec:lhc} will describe the LHC complex and beamline, while the ATLAS detector will be described in section \ref{sec:atlas_detector}.
The changes in the ATLAS configuration for Run 3 will be discussed in section \ref{sec:run3_changes}.
Hardware and software upgrade work on the ATLAS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be discussed in section \ref{sec:hl-lhc-upgrades}.
