The results presented in this thesis were obtained with the ATLAS detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) during the Run 2 and Run 3 data-taking periods.
Section \ref{sec:lhc} will describe the LHC complex and beamline, while the ATLAS detector in the Run 2 configuration will be described in section \ref{sec:atlas_detector}.
ATLAS underwent upgrades during the LHC's second long shutdown (LS2) from 2019-2021, and the detector in the Run 3 configuration will be described in section \ref{subsec:run3_config}.
Hardware and software upgrades of the ATLAS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be discussed in chapter \ref{ch:hl-lhc-atlas-upgrades}.
