The results presented in this thesis were obtained with the ATLAS detector located at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) during the Run 2 and Run 3 data-taking periods.
Section \ref{sec:lhc} will describe the LHC complex and beamline, while the ATLAS detector in the Run 2 configuration will be described in section \ref{sec:atlas_detector}.
The changes in the ATLAS configuration for Run 3 will be explicitly discussed in section \ref{sec:run3_changes}.
Hardware and software upgrades of the ATLAS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will be discussed in section \ref{sec:hl-lhc-upgrades}.
